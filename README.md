This program was created as the final project for the course Math of Perspective Drawing. It displays cubes in either one or two point perspective, and allows the position of the viewer to be moved in all 3 dimensions. My goal was to implement the perspective therom we had learned in class in code and learn a little about computer graphics.

## To Run
1. Download and unzip persp_proj.zip
2. Open the folder labelled with your OS (ex. application.windows64 for Windows 64x)
3. Run the file named persp_proj in that folder
